# Beyond-the-Runway-A-Deeper-Look-at-Aviation-Safety
This project analyzes historical aviation accident data in the United States to identify trends, patterns, and potential areas for improvement in aviation safety. The dashboard provides a visual representation of key findings.
Dashboard Components and Key Insights:

Part 1:
Total Accidents: A high number of 82,248 accidents are reported in the US, constituting 92.53% of the total.
Accident Trend: The line graph shows a general downward trend in accidents over time, suggesting improvements in safety measures. However, there are fluctuations and potential spikes in certain years that warrant further investigation.
Top Accident Locations: Anchorage, AK, and Miami, FL, are highlighted as locations with a high number of accidents. This could indicate factors specific to these airports, such as weather conditions, traffic density, or operational procedures.
Accident by Purpose of Flight: Personal flights are the most common type of flight associated with accidents, followed by instructional flights. This information is valuable for risk assessment and targeted safety initiatives.
Accident by Phase of Flight: The chart emphasizes the critical phases of landing and takeoff, where a significant number of accidents occur. This highlights the importance of rigorous safety protocols during these stages.
Part 2:
Aviation Accident for Airplane Category: The pie chart shows the distribution of accidents across different airplane categories. This information can be used to assess the safety performance of different aircraft types.
Total Aircraft Damage: The pie chart reveals the extent of damage in accidents, with a substantial portion categorized as "Substantial" damage. This underscores the severity of many aviation incidents.
No of Accidents & % of Total by Phase of Flight: This table provides a detailed breakdown of accidents by flight phase, reinforcing the findings from Part 1 regarding the critical nature of landing and takeoff.
Potential Use Cases and Next Steps:
Aviation Safety Authorities: The dashboard can be a valuable tool for identifying high-risk airports, flight phases, and aircraft types. This information can guide resource allocation and targeted safety interventions.
Airline Operators: The analysis can inform risk management strategies, flight training programs, and operational procedures to enhance safety.
Researchers: The data can be used for further research on accident causes, contributing to a deeper understanding of aviation safety issues.
Next Steps:
Drill-down Analysis: Further analysis can be conducted by drilling down into specific accident categories, locations, or time periods to uncover more detailed insights.
Predictive Modeling: Predictive models could be developed to forecast future accident risks based on historical data and identify potential areas of concern.
Data Enrichment: Integrating additional data sources, such as weather data and aircraft maintenance records, could enhance the analysis and provide a more comprehensive understanding of accident factors.

Overall, the Airport Accident Analysis dashboard provides a valuable overview of aviation safety trends and can be a powerful tool for decision-making and improvement initiatives in the aviation industry.
